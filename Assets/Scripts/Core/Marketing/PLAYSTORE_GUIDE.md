# Neon Protocol - Marketing & App Store Guidelines

This document outlines the visual standards for the Google Play Store release of **Neon Protocol**.

## 1. App Icon (The "Face" of the Game)
**Prompt:** `Flat 2D vector mobile game app icon. Stylized neon-magenta skull inside a cracked 1980s astronaut helmet. Background: Dark cyan digital grid. Style: High-contrast, clean, minimalist, bold outlines. No text. Centered on white background.`
- **Optimization:** Export as 512x512 PNG. Ensure the magenta-to-cyan contrast is high to stand out against standard Android home screen wallpapers.

## 2. Feature Graphic (The "Hook")
**Prompt:** `AAA cinematic 1024x500 Feature Graphic. Four 1980s teenagers back-to-back in a dark neon arcade. Firing glowing sci-fi weapons into a cosmic zombie horde. Lighting: Vibrant pink/cyan. Heavy volumetric fog. Unreal Engine 5 render style.`
- **Design Rule:** Keep the "Safe Zone" in the center 600px. Google Play often overlays text or crops the edges on different devices.

## 3. Store Screenshots
- **Action Shot:** Player performing a G-Slide while shooting a "Glitch" Zombie.
- **Progression:** The "Synth-Infuser" (Pack-a-Punch) UI showing a weapon upgrade.
- **Atmosphere:** A wide shot of the "Procedural Neon Arena" with the "Purple Moon" skybox.

## 4. Technical Metadata
- **Category:** Action / FPS
- **Content Rating:** PEGI 12 / ESRB T (Teen)
- **Engine:** Unity URP (Android Optimized)
